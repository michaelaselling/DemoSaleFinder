# DemoSaleFinder

Second Android-project I made. 

Prototype for an application that helps the user find shops that have sales, by showing
these shops on a map. The user can create an account (required to use the app), log in and view available
shops on the map. To find the right shops you are looking for, you can choose to filter by shop type
(clothing, shoes or electronics) or after the amount of sales the shops offer. For each shop on the map,
the shops addressand sale precentage is displayed and by clicking on the info box you can access the shops website.
The user can add and remove favorite shops and also reach the shops websites by entering the account view.
